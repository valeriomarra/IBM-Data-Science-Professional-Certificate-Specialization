Such data are necessary to analyze the neighborhoods to determine, for example, the most common venues and cluster them. By examining the clusters a determination regarding the discriminating venue categories that distinguish each cluster can be made. Moreover, information such as overall rating, number of tips, agree counts, Foursquare users and users' friends, and popular and trending spots around a venue, are available for any further analysis needed by the stakeholders.\n\n### Description of audience and why they would care about the problem\nThe target audience for this data science problem are the stakeholders interested in opening a restaurant in the city of choice. The target audience cares about this problem because picking the right neighborhood is of the essence for the success of their business venture.",

Learning most common venues and clustering techniques depend on such data.\n\n### Description of the source of the data\nFoursquare is a location data provider. By constructing a specific URL a request can be sent to the Foursquare API to: search for a specific type of venue around a given location, learn more about a specific venue, learn more about a specific Foursquare user, explore a given location, explore trending venues around a given location.",
